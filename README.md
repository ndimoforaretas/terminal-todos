## Code Explanation

The code is written in JavaScript using modern ES6+ syntax. The `readline-sync` package is used to handle user input in the terminal. Here's a brief overview of the main parts of the code:

- **Importing readline-sync**: The `readline-sync` module is imported using ES6 `import` syntax.
- **ASCII Art**: The `appTitle` constant contains the ASCII art for the application title.
- **Menu Display**: The `showMenu` function displays the main menu options.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `viewToDoList` function displays all items in the to-do list.
  - `addToDoItem` function allows the user to add a new item to the list.
  - `editToDoItem` function allows the user to edit an existing item in the list.
  - `deleteToDoItem` function allows the user to delete an item from the list.
- **Main Function**:
  - `startToDoListManager` function contains the main loop that runs the application, displaying the menu and handling user input based on their choices.
